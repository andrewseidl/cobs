# CoBS: The Container Build Service
CoBS builds container images for alternative hardware architectures, such as ARM and POWER. It can also be used as a regular x86_64 build service, similar to [Docker Hub's automated builds](http://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/) and [CoreOS's Quay](https://quay.io).

Initial development occurred as part of the [Gopher Gala](https://www.gophergala.com).

# Current Status
Not working. Development will resume shortly.
